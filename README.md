# Code-Refactor

Assignment: The marketing agent has asked the code on the website be simplified to make it more accessable and readable anyone who visits the sitebut without changing the look of the website.
Changes made to the code:
Deleted space between lines 2 and 4 as it was excess.
Removed the space on line nine so the banner has no bulleted list in it.
Deleted line 80 as it was excess space and didn't effect the layout or appearance of the website.
On line 11, the <div> tag was replaces with a <nav> tag.
The changes were made to elminate unnecessary code and streamline the page layout.
